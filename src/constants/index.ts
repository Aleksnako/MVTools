// All Manifest V3 extensions need an add-on ID in their manifest when submitting to the Firefox Add-ons store.
// This ID is used to identify the extension in the store and in the browser.
// The ID must be unique and in the format of a UUID.
// More info: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/extensions-and-the-add-on-id/

export const FIREFOX_ADDON_ID = '{unkown}' // Replace with the UUID of the extension
